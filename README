I will be going through on how to clone my project from GIT hub to your VMware image. 
For starters, open up your web browser and type this (or copy and paste) URL 
into the address bar ‘https://github.com/joao92/WebArch_Ass3’.

Leave this page open and open yourself a terminal that’s located on your Linux desktop.
Now that you have terminal open, type in ‘git clone git@github.com:joao92/WebArch_Ass3.git’. 
The project should now be downloading. After its finished downloading, 
type ‘ls’ into terminal so you can see if the project folder that you have just cloned exists. 
Change the directory by typing ‘cd WebArch_Ass3’. 
The only file that’s in this folder is a ‘README’ file; to get to the grails app we need to change branches. 
We do this by typing ‘git checkout develope’ into terminal (yes I spelt it wrong), 
now type ‘ls’ to see if a placement file is in there, change directory by typing ‘cd placement’ 
and now you should be in the grails app folder. Simply type, ‘grails run-app’ to run the application.
